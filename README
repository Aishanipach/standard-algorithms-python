This project has python implementation of longest increasing subsequence, prefix tree, longest common subsequence, knapsack 0-1(element repeated), knapsack 0-1(without repetition) and djikstra. I plan to add many more standard algorithms in the future. These are very basic implementations and can be modified for personal use.
